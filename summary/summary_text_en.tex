This thesis focuses on adaptive supervised learning techniques, where adaptivity to changes in data over time is achieved by selective training set formation. 
Our research design follows the three main drift types, starting from sudden change, via gradual drift to reoccurring concepts.
We develop methodological contributions to concept drift phenomenon in data mining tasks as well as four algorithms for training set formation under different application contexts and expected change types.
